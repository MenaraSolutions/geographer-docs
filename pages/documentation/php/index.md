Welcome to the official PHP package of Geographer. PHP package only contains array manipulation
classes necessary for the fluent API. All data is stored in language-agnostic JSON repo.

### Why do you need this?

If your application has a dropdown with country list, or perhaps you have a feed with location markers, you 
may be tired of polluting your database and application code with all these cities and states and coordinates.
