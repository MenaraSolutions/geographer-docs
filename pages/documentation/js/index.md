Welcome to the official JavaScript package of Geographer. This package only contains array manipulation
classes necessary for the fluent API. All data is stored in language-agnostic JSON repo.

[JavaScript package on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geographer-js)

### Why do you need this?

If your application has a dropdown with country list, or perhaps you have a feed with location markers, you 
may be tired of polluting your database and application code with all these cities and states and coordinates.

This makes more sense for Node.js (backend) applications because of the high overhead (big data files)
